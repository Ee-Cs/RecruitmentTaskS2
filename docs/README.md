## Description of the business logic
1. When the "Home" page is selected:
  - The chosen dataset is loaded.
  - Four datasets are available:
    - Standard
      - Dataset described in the business requirements.
      - Used in Cypress tests.
    - Large Scale
      - 182 missions.
      - Each mission contains 182 rockets.
      - Total number of rockets: 33,124.
      - Generated report spans approximately 850 pages.
    - Long Names
      - Single mission with a long name.
      - A single rocket with a long name is assigned to this mission.
      - Names may be up to 300 characters.
    - Empty
      - No missions and no rockets.
      - Used in Cypress tests.
  - The selected dataset is saved to local storage.
  - The previously saved dataset is overwritten.

2. When the "Manage Missions" page is selected:
  - Create, read, update, and delete operations for missions.
  - For each mission: create, read, update, and delete operations for rockets.
  - Implemented features:
    - Changing mission and rocket statuses.
    - Pagination with options for 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, or 200 records per page.
    - Default pagination: 5 records per page.
    - Sorting by name or status.

3. When the "Transfer Rockets" page is selected:
  - The right pane shows unassigned rockets (the rocket pool).
  - The left pane shows rockets of the selected mission that are not in space.
  - Create an unassigned rocket with status "On Ground".
  - Add that unassigned rocket to the rocket pool.
  - Assign rockets from the rocket pool to the selected mission.
  - Unassign rockets from the selected mission and transfer them to the rocket pool.

4. When the "Create PDF Reports" page is selected:
  - The application generates a PDF report.
  - The generated file can be opened, downloaded, or printed.
  - The "Missions and Rockets Report" provides a summary of missions.
  - Missions in the report are sorted by the number of rockets assigned.
  - Each mission entry shows the mission status and all rockets assigned to that mission.

## Testing
- Unit tests for components and services.
- End-to-end (integration) tests using Cypress.\
  The 32 [screenshots](https://github.com/ee-cs/RecruitmentTaskS2/tree/main/cypress/screenshots)
  generated by Cypress.
- [Live demo](https://ee-cs.github.io/RecruitmentTaskS2/) with multiple datasets.

## Development
<details>
<summary>Proposed validation logic to implement</summary>

- Before setting a rocket status to "In Space", ensure that the mission is not "Scheduled".
- Before setting a rocket status to "In Repair", ensure that the mission is "Pending".
- Before changing a mission status from "Pending" to another status, ensure no rocket in the mission has status "In Repair".
- Before changing a mission status to "In Progress", ensure no rocket in the mission has status "In Repair".
- Before changing a mission status to "Ended", ensure no rocket in the mission has status "In Space".
- Rockets must not be assigned to missions with status "Ended"; rockets may only be unassigned from such missions.

<summary>Proposed enhancements</summary>
Replace in-memory store with appropriate database.\
Add authorization and authentication.\
Add a business process model and a decision model for missions and rockets workflow.\
Add a blockchain for missions and rockets management.\
Switch to nanoservices on cloud platform.
